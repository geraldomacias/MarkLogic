We will respond to your request within 30 days of accepting it. Before accepting your request we may need to ask for some identity documentation from you, to make sure we don’t inadvertently provide your personal information to someone else.
If you are not in the EU, you can still apply for one of these rights, and we will comply where the request is reasonable in our discretion.

A. EDITING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION.
If you find that your personal information needs to be edited or updated, you can change your personal information directly on the site. Our Digital Tools offer different options for you to access, change, and modify the information you previously provided, such as your donor or customer record (for registered users only), email address, postal address, or to stop a duplicate email.

If one of our Digital Tools does not give you the option to edit personal information yourself or you wish to update the personal information we otherwise hold about you, you can ask us to update it by contacting us at CapTeamMark@gmail.com. Please make sure to provide us with all the information we need to be able to address your request, including both the old and new information.

If you ask us, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information free of charge. We may charge you a fee to cover our administrative costs if you request multiple copies of the same information or if the requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive.

Where we process your personal information based upon our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to this processing on grounds relating to your particular situation if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

Where we process your personal information based upon our legitimate interests and where decisions are made by automated processing which has a legal or other significant effect on you, you may also object to such automated decision making.

F. PORTABILITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.
You can request us to send you your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format so that it can easily be transferred and used by a third party if:
- you provided us with the personal information;
- the processing of your personal information is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract; or
- the processing is carried out by automated means.

G. WITHDRAWING CONSENT.
We primarily rely on legitimate business interests to process your data, but to the extent we use consent to process your data, you have the right to withdraw any consent you may have given us at any time. We will comply with your request promptly.

 If you withdraw your consent, we might not be able to provide some of our products and services to you. At any point, you have the right to object to processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes and we will promptly comply with your request.

7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
We are an international organization and we might need to transfer your personal information to other countries. If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), please be aware that we may need to transfer your data to countries outside the EEA to process it. We will only transfer your personal information outside the EEA with adequate safeguards in place and in full compliance with applicable laws. For example, we will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection. We have established standard contractual clauses with our service providers to ensure they protect your information and to enforce legal transfers of data internationally.

8. SECURITY.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from being accidentally lost, misused or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. These include technical, administrative and physical security measures to ensure that any information we collect is stored and processed securely.
For example, for Digital Tools that require personal or sensitive data to be collected or displayed, a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) connection is required, to ensure that the data is encrypted as it is transferred to the browser. All credit card payments are processed using PCI compliant technology, to ensure that your credit card number is securely passed to the merchant/service provider. We do not store your credit card details.
We have procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and we will promptly notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach in accordance with our legal obligations. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we implement in connection with the operation of the site will absolutely prevent others from accessing or acquiring any information that you provide while using the site. You can help us protect your personal information by properly protecting your password and remembering to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish visiting our site, especially if you are on a shared or public computer.

9. COOKIES AND INFORMATION COLLECTED BY TECHNOLOGY.
The digital tool may use cookies to keep track of web site activities, save your password or deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.

10. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
We keep your information as long as it is needed to achieve our purposes listed above, as well as for the amount of time necessary to meet any legal, tax, or reporting requirements.

We do not keep your personal information for longer than necessary and up to 7 years after your last interaction with us (e.g. making a donation, registering for an event, or using one of our Digital Tools). We may keep your data for longer than 7 years for legal or technical reasons. We may also keep it for statistical purposes. However, if we do, we will ensure that your privacy continues to be protected and only use it for these purposes.

11. THIRD PARTY SITES AND INFORMATION.
The site may contain links to Digital Tools that are run by third parties such as other organizations, sponsors, content providers and advertisers. Once you’ve clicked on a link or button activator for an outside website, you will leave the site and be taken to sites that we do not control, and our privacy policy no longer applies on those sites.
You must read the privacy policy of the third party website concerning how personal information will be used. We also provide content created by third parties on some of our Digital Tools. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such content providers or third party sites.

12. SPECIAL RULES FOR CHILDREN.
We do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 beyond what is necessary for them to participate in our online or other activities, such as registering for a conference or downloading materials. If we discover that we have accidentally collected personal information from a child below the age of 13, we will delete it from our records as soon as reasonably possible.
If a child, under the age of 16 in the EEA, or under the age of 13 elsewhere, attempts to register with one of our Digital Tools, purchase products or materials, or participate in an activity requiring the submittal of personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian must give permission and consent for that child to provide information and register. The only personal information we collect from a child is information that is necessary for the child to participate in activities, such as an address for making a purchase. Parents have the right to request at any time that the information collected about their child is removed from our database.

13. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2018 will receive information regarding 2017 sharing activities). Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements.
